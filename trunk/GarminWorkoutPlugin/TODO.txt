TODO :
- Be able to export directly to older non mass-storage device
- Drag & drop step to move them inside the workout
- Copy/paste steps of a workout to another workout
- Allow to select which workouts to export (instead of all)
- Complete globalization
- Add last export date
- Add possiblity to plan a workout
- Select Garmin workout category (Running, Cycling, Other) for correct GTC import

Nice to have :
- Add a help web site/file
- Put important info in steps list in bold
- Check if the limit of 20 steps can be bypassed
