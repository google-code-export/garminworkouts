Known bugs :
- SportTracks categories are lost when exporting to device (Communicator plugin bug)
- Power targets aren't exported/imported correctly from device (Communicator plugin bug) (Use export/import to/from file instead)
- Multiple exports of the same workout doesn't overwrite (Communicator plugin bug) (delete the workout on the unit prior to exporting for it to work)

TODO :
- Copy/paste steps of a workout to another workout
- Allow to select which workouts to export (instead of all)
- Complete globalization
- Add last export date
- Add possiblity to plan a workout
- Select Garmin workout category (Running, Cycling, Other) for correct GTC import

Nice to have :
- Add a help web site/file
- Put important info in steps list in bold
- Check if the limit of 20 steps can be bypassed
