#summary Explains how to setup the Garmin Workouts plugin using the dedicated settings page

= Introduction =
So you've just installed the Garmin Workouts plugin for [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks]?  Of course the first thing you want to do is configure it to your needs.  This is what the settings page is for.  This page allows you to enable or disable [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] integration inside the plugin.  This way you can use it exactly as it is done in Garmin Training Center, or you can use the different options that [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] offers.  Let's see how it's done!

== Accessing the settings ==
First of all, you want to access the settings page.  To do so, simply select the "Settings" link in the "Other tasks" panel to the left.

Once cllicked, this link will lead you to the settings page which has a special section for plugins.  In this section, you will find the "Garmin Workouts Settings" that looks like this.

== Categories ==
=== Workouts and categories ===
When first developing the plugin, I had to make a choice when it came to zones.  On one hand, the different Garmin fitness units use some user-defined zones.  On the other hand, [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] uses it's own user-defined zones.  In the first version of the plugin, only Garmin zones were supported and event then, only for the heart rate target type.  After some discussions with the different early users, it was decided to give the user the choice to use either Garmin or [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] zones.  This lead to the option in the settings page.  As you can see you have the choice for every type of available target to use either Garmin or [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] zones by selecting the right combo box.  This affects the list of predefined zones that will be displayed when you define your target for a workout's step.  For instance, if I set the heart rate setting to "Garmin", the list will look as follows

If you select the [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] zone, it will be populated with your own [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] defined zones.  In my case it looks like this

=== Resetting a step's category ===
Now that you have discovered how to change between Garmin and [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] zones you might want to change your already created workouts.  when doing so, you will notice that they have kept their old values regardless of the new setting value.  This is to prevent having invalid steps in a workout.  So you might wonder how you can apply the setting to your steps.  This is simple, you must simply choose the "Custom" zone to repopulate the list with the right (Garmin or [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks]) zones.

=== Specifying the zone categories ===
In the settings page you will also have noticed that you can select the zone categories to use for cadence and power.  This allows you to select which zone category will be used for the cadence and power target respectively.  Opening the listbox will list all of the zones you have defined for either cadence or power.

For the heart rate and speed targets, the listbox will be populated with the heart rate and speed zone category as defined in the "Activity categories" of the "Categories" view.  As you can see below, I chose to use the "Cycling" heart rate zones and those zones are what appear in the target's listbox..

Since I use information contained within the activity category, it is very important to select the right activity category when creating your workouts.  Failure to do so will result in the display of the wrong zones in your target.

You can also notice the reason why the user is given the selection of what cadence and power zone to use.  These options are simply not available in the activity categories.  At the moment, there is no option to select what zone to use on a per-activity category basis.

== Default export directory ==
The last option available in the settings page is the "Default Export Directory".  This option is used when you select to export your workouts to files.  Rather than asking for the directory at every time you export, the directory entered in this option will automatically be selected, speeding up the export process.
