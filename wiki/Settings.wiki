== Workouts and categories ==
When first developing the plugin, I had to make a choice when it came to zones.  On one hand, the different Garmin fitness units use some user-defined zones.  On the other hand, [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] uses it's own user-defined zones.  In the first version of the plugin, only Garmin zones were supported and event then, only for some the heart rate target type.  After some discussions with the different early users, it was decided to give the user the choice to use either Garmin or [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] zones.  This lead to the option in the settings page.  As you can see you have the choice for every type of available target to use either Garmin or [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] zones by selecting the right combo box.  This affects the list of predefined zones that will be displayed when you define your target for a workout's step.  For instance, if I set the heart rate setting to "Garmin", the list will look as follows

If you select the [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] zone, it will be populated with your own [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] defined zones.  In my case it looks like this
