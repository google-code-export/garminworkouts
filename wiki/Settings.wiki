= Introduction =
So you've just installed the Garmin Fitness Plugin for [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks]!  Of course the first thing you want to do is configure it to your needs.  This is what the settings page is for.  This page allows you to enable or disable [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] integration inside the plugin.  This way you can use it exactly as it is done in Garmin Training Center, or you can use the different options that [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] offers.  Let's see how it's done!

= Accessing the settings =
First of all, you want to access the settings page.  To do so, simply select the "Settings" link in the "Other tasks" panel to the left.

Once clicked, this link will lead you to the settings page which has a special section for plugins.  In this section, you will find the "Garmin Fitness Settings".  An alternate way of accessing the settings page is to click on the settings button http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Settings%20Button.gif in the upper right corner of the Garmin Fitness view.  Both methods lead you to the following screen :

= Zone categories =
== Workouts and zone categories ==
When first developing the plugin, I had to make a choice when it came to zones.  On one hand, the different Garmin Fitness devices use some user-defined zones.  On the other hand, [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] uses it's own user-defined zones.  In the first version of the plugin, only Garmin zones were supported and event then, only for the heart rate target type.  After some discussions with the different early users, it was decided to give the user the choice to use either Garmin or [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] zones.  This lead to the option in the settings page.  As you can see you have the choice for every type of available target to use either Garmin or [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] zones by selecting the right combo box.  This affects the list of predefined zones that will be displayed when you define your target for a workout's step.  For instance, if I set the heart rate setting to "Garmin", the list will look as follows

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Garmin%20zones.gif

If you select the [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] zone, it will be populated with your own [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] defined zones.  In my case it looks like this

== Resetting a step's category ==
Now that you have discovered how to change between Garmin and [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] zones you might want to change your already created workouts.  when doing so, you will notice that they have kept their old values regardless of the new setting value.  This is to prevent having invalid steps in a workout.  So you might wonder how you can apply the setting to your steps.  This is simple, you must simply choose the "Custom" zone to repopulate the list with the right (Garmin or [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks]) zones.

== Specifying the zone categories ==
In the settings page you will also have noticed that you can select the zone categories to use for cadence and power.  This allows you to select which zone category will be used for the cadence and power target respectively.  Opening the listbox will list all of the zones you have defined for either cadence or power.

For the heart rate and speed targets, the listbox will be populated with the heart rate and speed zone category as defined in the "Activity categories" of the "Categories" view.  As you can see below, I chose to use the "Cycling" heart rate zones and those zones are what appear in the target's listbox..

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Cycling%20HR%20Zones.gif

Since I use information contained within the activity category, it is very important to select the right activity category when creating your workouts.  Failure to do so will result in the display of the wrong zones in your target.

You can also notice the reason why the user is given the selection of what cadence and power zone to use.  These options are simply not available in the activity categories.  At the moment, there is no option to select what zone to use on a per-activity category basis.

For the heart rate, there is an extra option only available when you select to use [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] zones.  This allows you to select whether these targets will be exported as BPM or as a percent of maximum heart rate.  This option is only available in version 1.1.278 or later.

= Allow workouts with more than 20 steps =
This option is also know as the "auto-split" feature.  The different Garmin Fitness units have a maximum of 20 steps per workout.  This limitation can definitely be annoying.  HENNES has found a clean workaround that the plugin implements.  It consists of splitting the workouts with more than 20 steps into multiple workouts that can be executed one after the other.  If you check this checkbox, this feature will be active, if not, the plugin will behave like Garmin Training Center and limit all workouts to 20 steps.

For more information on how to use this feature, head to the [http://code.google.com/p/garminworkouts/wiki/AdvancedOperations?ts=1232236954&updated=AdvancedOperations#Workouts_with_more_than_20_steps Advanced Operations] section.

= Garmin activity categories =
To integrate the Garmin Workouts Plugin seamlessly into [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks], it was chosen to associate every activity category to a Garmin activity category.  Garmin only provides 3 categories : running, biking and other.  Each of these categories has their own speed and heart rate zones.  The "Biking" category also has power zones.  Since these zones might not match with the zones defined in [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks], you must decide to which sport each [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] corresponds.  This is what the section is for and it looks like the following :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Categories%20settings.gif

By default, all categories are assigned to Garmin's "Other" activity category.  To change this, simply click on the zone you wish to modify.  For instance, if I click on "Running" I get the following :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Running%20category%20details.gif

You notice that it is currently set to inherit it's parent setting which is the following :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/My%20Activities%20category%20details.gif

To change the "Running" activity category setting, you must use the radio buttons to the right.  Since you don't want to inherit the parent's category anymore, start by clicking on the "Use custom category" radio button.  This enables the following three radio buttons for you to select the right one.  Of course it makes sense to choose the "Running" Garmin category.  This gives the following result :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Running%20category%20modified%20details.gif

You can notice that all the children have been updated to "Running".  That is because they all have the "Use parent category" setting.  If any one of those categories was overriden, it would have kept it's setting.

= Device Communication =
== Default export directory ==
The last option available in the settings page is the "Default Export Directory".  This option is used when you select to export your workouts to files.  Rather than asking for the directory at every time you export, the directory entered in this option will automatically be selected, speeding up the export process.

== Pack workouts for export ==
The Forerunner 405 is a special device for Garmin.  For some reason this devices has unique behaviors.  One of those behaviors is that it can only transfer 1 workout file at once.  For this reason, users of the FR405 should enable this option to "pack" all workouts in one file at export.  For users of other devices, this is unnecessary and can lead to problems at export so it should remain unchecked.

Once you are done setting up the plugin, you can move on to the [BasicOperations basic operations].
