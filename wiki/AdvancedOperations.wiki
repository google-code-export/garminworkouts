= Introduction =
So you've mastered the basic operations?  It wasn't so hard, was it?  You are now ready for the advanced operations.  These different operations will help you become faster when you create or manage your workouts.  Let's see in what it consists.

= Advanced workout operations =
There are three advanced operations that are related to the workouts.  They are drag & dropping, copy & pasting ans scheduling.  The first two do the same thing, they allow you to move or make a copy of a workout.  The third one allows you to schedule your workouts in time.

== Multiple selection ==
The advanced workout operations can be done on multiple items at once.  To select multiple items you must hold a key on the keyboard when clicking in the workouts list. Hold either the CTRL key to add/remove the clicked item to the selection or hold SHIFT to select all items between your last selection and the item you just clicked.

Here is the effet of selecting two items using the CTRL key :

Here is the effet of selecting multiple items using the SHIFT key :

Note that when multiple workouts are selected, only the advanced operations are available.  That means you can't edit or view your steps.

In the following examples, I'll always work with a single item selected for the sake of simplicity but the operations are done exactly the same way with a multiple selection.

== Drag and dropping ==
The first way to move or copy workouts is by using drap and dropping.  Drag & dropping is a common technique in many software.  It consists in clicking an item and, while holding the left mouse button, moving the mouse until you release the button.  It's as if you were grabbing on an object, moving it and then releasing it at it's destination.

=== Changing a workout's category ===
Using the above technique, you can change a workout's category.  It's very simple to do, simply click the item you want to move, when dragging you willl see you mouse icon change to the following :

Simply release the mouse button on the destination category and your workout will be moved accordingly.

=== Copying a workout ===
Basically, copying a workout is done in the same manner.  The only difference is that you must hold the CTRL key on the keyboard when releasing the mouse button.  You will notice that the mouse pointer will also change to the copy icon.

== Copy-Pasting ==
As mentionned previously, drag & dropping is the mouse equivalent of copy pasting.  In fact this is not 100% true.  Truth is that copy pasting is more versatile because it allows you to paste in a different logbook.  That means you can have a workout duplicated in two logbooks.  This can be useful when starting a new logbook and wanting to transfer your workouts to it.

To copy-paste workouts and steps, you can use the three buttons located in the upper left corner of the Garmin Fitness view.  They look like this : http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Clipboard%20buttons.gif

Alternately, you can use the following three keyboard shortcuts :

  # CTRL-X : This shortcut corresponds to the "cut" command.  It makes a copy of your workouts for you to paste and removes them immediately for the current logbook.  Hitting this shortcut is equivalent to the move drag & drop operation described above.
  # CTRL-C : This shortcut corresponds to the "copy" command.  Just like the "cut" operation, it makes a copy of your selected workouts but it differs in that it doesn't remove the workouts from the logbook.  Hitting this shortcut is equivalent to the copy  drag & drop operation (holding CTRL) described above.
  # CTRL-V This shortcut corresponds to the "paste" command.  This operation takes the copy made during the "cut" or "copy" and returns it to the logbook.  Hitting this shortcut is equivalent to releasing the mouse button in the drag & drop operations described above.

To determine in what category your workouts will be pasted, simply select that category before hitting the "paste" keyboard shortcut.

== Scheduling ==
Scheduling your workouts should be an integral part of your training.  For this purpose, Garmin allows you to schedule dates on which you will do your workouts.  In this plugin, planning is done by using the calendar in the lower left.

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Workout%20schedule.gif

Planned dates are maked with a little red triangle on a certain date.  The selected date is marked with a full square.  The two buttons right above the calendar are used to respectively plan a workout or remove a planned date.

=== Scheduling a workout ===
Scheduling a workout is very simple, simply select all the workouts you want to do on a given day, then select that day and click on the "schedule workout" button http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Schedule%20workout%20button.gif

If you want to plan your workout on the 31st of October, start by selecting that date :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Workout%20scheduling%20operation-b.gif

Then you click on the "schedule workout" button.  You get the following result.  Notice that the 31st now has a small red triangle in the upper left, which means your workout has been planned.

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Workout%20scheduling%20result-b.gif

Note that when selecting a date, it must be today or in the future.  Planning a workout in the past is useless so it is not allowed.

=== Removing a planned workout ===
It seems some people make mistakes, so what are you going to do when you've planned your workout on the wrong date?  Remove it of course.  The button right next to the "schedule workout" button http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Delete%20Workout%20Button.gif is there for this exact purpose.  When you select a date with a workout planned it will be enabled.  Click it and the sheduling will be removed.

For instance, with the above example, if we made a mistake and wanted to plan, not on the 31st but on the 1st of November.  After all we ate a lot of candy the previous evening and we have to lose that extra weight.  Start by selecting the 31st, then hit the "remove shedule" button.  The little red triangle disappears, all is good.

=== Workouts planned on a certain day ===
Often, we would like to know what workouts were planned on a certain date, to prepare ourselves mentally I suppose.  For this purpose the plugin uses the  [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] calendar in the upper left corner.  You might not have noticed, but as you plan your workouts, the dates on which workouts are planned get highlighted.

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/SportTracks%20calendar.gif

Clicking on a date here will select all the workouts which have been planned for that date.  For instance, clicking on the 31st of October yields the following result :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/SportTracks%20calendar%20result.gif

You can see that "!NewWorkout 3" and "!NewWorkout 5" were planned on the 31st.  

=== Add to logbook ===
There is a check box just above the scheduling calendar http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Add%20to%20logbook.gif that is used to create a copy of the workout in the "Daily Activity" view every time you schedule it.  Some people use the workouts simply as a timer and are not interested in importing those workouts from their device.  In this case, you still want to know when you executed a given workout and checking this option allows you to save time by automatically creating the activity in your logbook.  For an activity planned on the 22nd of january, I get the following :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Add%20to%20logbook%20result.gif

=== Workouts with more than 20 steps ===
As mentionned in the [Settings settings page], it is allowed to have workouts with more than 20 steps if the option is active.  These workouts will be automatically split up in portions of up to 20 steps.  When the workout is split in multiple parts, you will see a column appearing that indicates in what part the step is.

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Multiple%20parts%20workout.gif

You will also notice that the workouts list has been updated to show the workout's parts.

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Multiple%20parts%20workout%20list.gif

You can select a specific part to edit it individually.  You cannot change its name or notes though as these are automatically generated from the master workout.  Note that when exporting to a file or to your device the master workout won't be exported, only the parts will be.  It is your responsability to go from one part to the next on your device when you wish todo this workout completely.

==== Forcing the split on a certain step ====
If the option to allow more than 20 steps per workout is active, there will be a new check box available for the steps on the root level.

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Force%20split%20checkbox.gif

This check box allows you to control on what step the next part will start.  This option is usefull if you prefer to have your parts start or finish with steps that have a certain property.  For instance, using a resting step as the first step in a workout is a good idea because it gives you time to start the next part.

When you check the "Force split" check box, you will see that the part number column updates itself.  A little star ("`*`") appears to make it easier to see that this split is the result of a force and the part numbers are updated.

= Advanced steps operations =
The advanced step operations are basically the same as the advanced workout steps, namely drag and dropping and copy-pasting.  Of course multiple selection is also possible.

== Multiple selection ==
Just like with the workouts, multiple step selection is acheived with the CTRL and SHIFT keys.  For more detail, read the above "Multiple selection" section.  One thing that is worth of mention though is repeat steps.  When selecting a repeat step, it will automatically select all of it's children.  So if you move or copy a repeat step, all it's children will also be moved or copied.  That means that when you select a repeat step and one of it's children, the second selection (the child) won't be double selected.  This means that the following two selections are considered the same and therefore all actions made with these selections will have the same result.

== Drag and dropping ==
Again, drag and dropping is done in the same manner as with workouts.  Hold CTRL to copy the selected steps or else they will be moved instead of copied.

The biggest difference between drag and dropping steps, as opposed to workouts, is regarding the order.  This is worthy of mention because it can be tricky.  The thing to remember though is that when dropping a step, it will always be placed on the same level as the step on top of which you release the mouse.  This is important because of repeat steps.  For instance you won't drop the step at the same position if you want your step to be the last one of the repeat as opposed to the one immediately following the repeat.  An illustrated example will help with the understanding.

Let's say that we start with the following scenario :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Step%20dragdrop%20example%201.gif

We have 9 steps, 8 regular steps and 1 repeat.  Now let's say I want to move the step 2 inside the repeat, as the second step.  This is an easy scenario, you simply drag and drop the step over it's destination (that is between step 4 and 5).  When dragging you will notice that a line serves as an idicator of the destination.

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Step%20dragdrop%20example%202.gif

Release the mouse gives us the following :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Step%20dragdrop%20example%203.gif

As I said, this is a simple scenario.  The complication comes when dealing with repeat borders.  Let's start with the same base.  Now what if I want to drag step 2 inside the repeat, after step 6.  We have two options but they will not give the same results.

The first option is to drop the step in the lower half of step 6 :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Step%20dragdrop%20example%204.gif

The second option is to drop the step in the upper half of step 7 :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Step%20dragdrop%20example%205.gif

In both cases the indication line is at the same spot.  Here is where you must remember the golden rule : "When dropping a step, it will always be placed on the same level as the step on top of which you release the mouse".  With that in mind, you immediately understand that you must choose to drop according to the first option.  This give the following result :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Step%20dragdrop%20example%206.gif

Had you chosen to drop over step 7, you would have gotten the following :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Step%20dragdrop%20example%207.gif

The same applies when you want to move a step before the first step inside a repeat.  You must drop over the upper half of the first step inside the reapeat to achieve this.

So be careful when moving steps around and always remember the golden rule.

== Copy-Pasting ==
There is nothing new with steps copy-pasting.  The steps can be copied inside a workout, between workouts and between logbooks in the same manner that is done with workouts.  See the [http://code.google.com/p/garminworkouts/w/edit.do#Copy-Pasting above section] about copy-pasting for more details.
