= Introduction =
So you've mastered the basic operations?  It wasn't so hard, was it?  You are now ready for the advanced operations.  These different operations will help you become faster when you create or manage your workouts.  Let's see in what it consists.

= Advanced workout operations =
There are three advanced operations that are related to the workouts.  They are drag & dropping, copy & pasting ans scheduling.  The first two do the same thing, they allow you to move or make a copy of a workout.  The third one allows you to schedule your workouts in time.

== Multiple selection ==
The advanced workout operations can be done on multiple items at once.  To select multiple items you must hold a key on the keyboard when clicking in the workouts list. Hold either the CTRL key to add/remove the clicked item to the selection or hold SHIFT to select all items between your last selection and the item you just clicked.

Here is the effet of selecting two items using the CTRL key :

Here is the effet of selecting multiple items using the SHIFT key :

Note that when multiple workouts are selected, only the advanced operations are available.  That means you can't edit or view your steps.

In the following examples, I'll always work with a single item selected for the sake of simplicity but the operations are done exactly the same way with a multiple selection.

== Drag and dropping ==
The first way to move or copy workouts is by using drap and dropping.  Drag & dropping is a common technique in many software.  It consists in clicking an item and, while holding the left mouse button, moving the mouse until you release the button.  It's as if you were grabbing on an object, moving it and then releasing it at it's destination.

=== Changing a workout's category ===
Using the above techinque, you can change a workout's category.  It's very simple to do, simply click the item you want to move, when dragging you willl see you mouse icon change to the following :

Simply release the mouse button on the destination category and your workout will be moved accordingly.

=== Copying a workout ===
Basically, copying a workout is done in the same manner.  The only difference is that you must hold the CTRL key on the keyboard when releasing the mouse button.  You will notice that the mouse pointer will also change to the copy icon.

== Copy-Pasting ==
As mentionned previously, drag & dropping is the mouse equivalent of copy pasting.  In fact this is not 100% true.  Truth is that copy pasting is more versatile because it allows you to paste in a different logbook.  That means you can have a workout duplicated in two logbooks.  This can be usefull when starting a new logbook and wanting to transfer your workouts to the it.

With copy-pasting, you must remember three following keyboard shortcuts :

  # CTRL-X : This shortcut corresponds to the "cut" command.  It makes a copy of your workouts for you to paste and removes them immediately for the current logbook.  Hitting this shortcut is equivalent to the move drag & drop operation described above.
  # CTRL-C : This shortcut corresponds to the "copy" command.  Just like the "cut" operation, it makes a copy of your selected workouts but it differs in that it doesn't remove the workouts from the logbook.  Hitting this shortcut is equivalent to the copy  drag & drop operation (holding CTRL) described above.
  # CTRL-V This shortcut corresponds to the "paste" command.  This operation takes the copy made during the "cut" or "copy" and returns it to the logbook.  Hitting this shortcut is equivalent to releasing the mouse button in the drag & drop operations described above.

To determine in what category your workouts will be pasted, simply select that category before hitting the "paste" keyboard shortcut.

== Scheduling ==
Scheduling your workouts should be an integral part of your training.  For this purpose, Garmin allows you to schedule dates on which you will do your workouts.  In this plugin, planning is done by using the calendar in the lower left.

Planned dates are maked with a little red triangle on a certain date.  The selected date is marked with a full square.  The two buttons right above the calendar are used to respectively plan a workout or remove a planned date.

=== Scheduling a workout ===
Scheduling a workout is very simple, simply select all the workouts you want to do on a given day, then select that day and click on the "schedule workout" button http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Schedule%20workout%20button.gif

If you want to plan your workout on the 31st of October, start by selecting that date :

Then you click on the "schedule workout" button.  Yoou get the following result.  Notice that the 31st now has a small red triangle in the upper left, which means your workout has been planned.

Note that when selecting a date, it must be today or in the future.  Planning a workout in the past is useless so it is not allowed.

=== Removing a planned workout ===
It seems some people make mistakes, so what are you going to do when you've planned your workout on the wrong date?  Remove it of course.  The button right next to the "schedule workout" button http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Delete%20Workout%20Button.gif is there for this exact purpose.  When you select a date with a workout planned it will be enabled.  Click it and the sheduling will be removed.

For instance, with the above example, if we made a mistake and wanted to plan, not on the 31st but on the 1st of November.  After all we ate a lot of candy the previous evening and we have to lose that extra weight.  Start by selecting the 31st, then hit the "remove shedule" button.  The little red triangle disappears, all is good.

=== Workouts planned on a certain day ===
Often, we would like to know what workouts were planned on a certain date, to prepare ourselves mentally I suppose.  For this purpose the plugin uses the  [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks SportTracks] calendar in the upper left corner.  You might not have noticed, but as you plan your workouts, the dates on which workouts are planned get highlighted.

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/SportTracks%20calendar.gif

Clicking on a date here will select all the workouts which have been planned for that date.  For instance, clicking on the 31st of October yields the following result :

You can see that "!NewWorkout 3" and "!NewWorkout 5" were planned on the 31st.
