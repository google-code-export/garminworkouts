= Managing workouts =

== Creating workouts ==
The first thing you will want to do is to create a workout.  For this purpose, you must first select the category you want to put the workout in.  I have selected My Activites/Cycling/Road but feel free to choose the right category that suits your own workout.  Once done, you must hit the new workout button, in the upper left.  http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/New%20Workout%20Button.gif  This creates a workout with a default name and that contains a single step.
