#summary This page describes the basic operations performed in the Garmin Workout Plugin

= Introduction =
Now that you're all set-up properly as described in the [Settings] page you are ready to create and manage your workouts.  Of course the basic operations are the same as in Garmin Training Center which is creating and deleting them, adding and removing steps, changing the order of those steps and of course filling them with the right information.  Keep on reading for instructions on accomplishing those tasks.

= Accessing the Garmin Workouts view =
To access the view available with the Garmin Workouts Plugin you will need to click on the link in the "Select View" menu.

This screen is where you will be able to do everything this plugin allows.

= Managing workouts =

== Creating workouts ==
The first thing you will want to do is to create a workout.  For this purpose, you must first select the category you want to put the workout in.  I have selected My Activites/Cycling/Road but feel free to choose the right category that suits your own workout.  Once done, you must hit the new workout button, in the upper left.  http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/New%20Workout%20Button.gif  This creates a workout with a default name and that contains a single step.

== Deleting a workout ==
When a workout is selected in the workouts list, you will notice that the delete workout button is enabled.  Deleting a workout is simple, simply hit the delete button that is also located in the upper left corner http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Delete%20Workout%20Button.gif

= Personalizing a workout =

== Changing the workout's name ==
Changing a workout's name is a simple task Simply click in the textbox next to the "Name :" label and enter your desired name.  The name you enter must be unique and cannot be empty

== Adding new steps ==
After changing the workout's name, you will want to add steps to your workout.  To do so, you have two buttons, one to add regular steps http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/New%20regular%20step%20button.gif, and one to add repeat steps http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/New%20repeat%20step%20button.gif  The devices are limited to 20 steps per workout.  Notice also that when a step is selected, the new step (either regular or repeat) will be added right after the selected step.  When there is no step selected, it will be added as the first step of the workout.

=== Repeat steps ===
Repeat steps are a special type of steps.  Basically, a repeat step contains a list of steps (either regular or repeat) that must be repeated a certain number of times before moving forward in the workout.  When creating a repeat step, it will automatically contain a single default step.

This is the result of adding 2 new steps, one regular and one repeat.

== Removing a step ==
Of course every so often you will want to remove a step from your workout.  A very simple button is meant for this purpose and you guessed it by now, it looks like this http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Delete%20Workout%20Button.gif.  Having empty workouts is useless so when you delete the last step of a workout, a new default step will automatically replace it.

=== Repeat steps ===
Again, repeat steps need some more explications.  First of all, deleting the repeat step will also delete all of it's children, so make sure this is really what you want to do.  Secondly, just like workouts, an empty repeat step makes no sense.  So when you delete the last child inside a repeat step, the repeat step will also be automatically deleted.


== Changing the steps order ==
Next to the creation and deletion buttons, you find two buttons that are used to change the order of the steps inside the workout http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Move%20buttons.gif.  The up arrow moves the step up one position inside the workout or inside the repeat step.  Opposingly, the down arrow moves the step down one position.

= Personalizing steps =
Of course all the above means nothing if you don't setup the different steps that your workout contains.  First of all, you can give a custom name to your step.  To do so, you must simply type a name in the textbox right next to the "Custom step name:" label.  You can also specify if the step is active or resting.  By default, the step will be set as being active, checking the box next to the custom name textbox will rectify this situation.

A step is composed of a duration and a target.  A step's duration defines when a certain step will end and the target defines a goal for a step.  Let's see how to define these elements.  Of course you must start by selecting the step you want to edit in the steps list.  This will enable the bottom section of the view as you can see in the following screenshot.

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Steps%20details.gif


== Selecting the step's duration ==
A step's duration is a condition that must be met for the step to end.  You have six different options for the duration

  # When you press the 'lap' button on your device
  # When you go for a certain distance
  # When you go for a certain amount of time
  # When your heart rate gets above a certain level
  # When your heart rate get below a certain level
  # When you have burned a certain number of calories

To choose the duration you desire, simply click on the drop down list in the "Step Duration" section.

Once you have made your selection, the interface will update to allow you to set the parameters you desire.  Depending on the type of duration, you will see one of the following :

|| For the 'Lap' button duration, you don't have to specify anything, you just press the 'Lap' button on your device when you wish the step to end. || http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Lap%20duration.gif ||
|| For a distance duration, you have to specify the desired distance.  Note that even though the unit is in kilometers in the following screenshot, the unit used will be the one specified for the category in which you put the workout. || http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Distance%20duration.gif ||
|| The time duration pops up a time control, that allows you to set the time you want for your step || http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Time%20duration.gif ||
|| For the heart rate above and below, you will see the same controls.  With this duration though you have two choices.  You can either specify the heart rate to acheive in beats per minute (bpm) or in percentage of you maximum heart rate (% Max HR).  The drop down list is used to specify which option you want to use. || http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/HR%20duration.gif ||
|| Finally, for the calories burned duration, a simple textbox allows you to set the number of calories desired. || http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Calories%20duration.gif ||

== Selecting the step's target ==
After selecting the right duration for your step, you must also set it's target.  This is done right below the duration portion, where you encounter the following :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Target%20expanded.gif

Just like the durations, you have multiple target types :

  # You have no specific target for this step
  # You want to keep your speed in a certain zone
  # You want to keep your cadence in a certain zone
  # You want to keep your heart rate in a certain zone
  # You want to keep your power in a certain zone

All of the target types use the same model, respectively you can select a predefined zone of define a custom one.  For instance if you choose to keep your cadence in a certain zone you will be offered the following :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Cadence%20expanded.gif

The custom zone corresponds to the first item in the list and all the other options are predefined zones.

=== Predefined target zones ===
Each one of the target types have their own predefined zones.  For added versatility, the plugin allows to use the zones already defined in [http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks/ SportTracks].  This is what you see in the above screenshot, my cadence zones are "Very low", "Low", "Normal", "High", "Very High" and "Extreme".  You can also use the standard Garmin zones.  To set which zones to use, head to the [Settings] page.

=== Custom target zone ===
It happens sometimes that your predefined zones don't correspond to what you want to target in your workout.  This is why the "Custom" option is available and when you select it, you are given text boxes to setup your zone.  Keeping up with the same example, you will get the following for a custom cadence target :

http://garminworkouts.googlecode.com/files/Cadence%20custom.gif

As you can see, you can now specify you minimum and maximum cadence for your target.  All the different target types follow the same pattern.

*Note on speed targets* : When setting up a custom speed target, you will be asked to enter the speed in either pace or in units per hour.  The usage of either pace or speed is determined by the category the workout has been put in.  If that category is set to use pace, so will the workout and vice-versa.
