= Introduction =

Profile editing is a very important feature if you want to use your unit to the maximum.  There are three different activities in Garmin Fitness units.  You have already played with them if you went through the Settings page.  These 3 activites are "Running", "Cycling" and "Other".  They all contain different heart rate and speed zones so that you can configure them for your own use.  So let's go through this part of the plugin.

= Accessing the profile view =

When you access the Garmin Fitness view, you are offered the "Workouts view" by default.  This is where you will spend most of your time so this makes sense.  The "Profile view" is accessible anytime by using the title bar.

In this bar, you can click on "Workouts" to display the available view, "Workouts" and "Profile".

This will allow you to navigate between both views easily.

= Profile editing =

Once you have clicked on "Profile" in the title bar's menu, you will be presented with the following :

As you can see, you can edit all your personal information here and edit your different zones.  To do so, simply click on the zone you wish to edit in the list and edit the information in the text boxes on the right.

== Changing the activity ==

As mentionned previously, Garmin provides 3 activity types.  As each activity type have their own information, you will want to edit them all.  As such, you will need to change the displayed activity.  In the banner that displays "Running", you will notice a small arrow to the right.  Clicking it yields the following result :

From there, simply click the activity you wish to edit.

== Cycling specificities ==

Garmin has thought about needs that are specific to cyclists in their profile.  As such, they've added some cycling only information in the profile.  When selecting "Biking" as your activity, you will notice that the following information is visible.

You can therefore edit your power zones and your different bike profiles.  There are three bike profiles allowed.  To access them, you can click on the arrow in the bike banner.

= Importing and exporting the profile =

As with the "Workouts view", importing and exporting workouts to the unit is done using the actions list located on the left on the screen.  It's pretty straightforward, simply click on the action you wish to execute.
